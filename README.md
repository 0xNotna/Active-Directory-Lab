# ðŸŽ‰Active-Directory-Lab 

## Objective

Simulated a real-world helpdesk environment by deploying a Windows Server-based Active Directory domain, provisioning users and organizational units, configuring Group Policy for mapped network drives, and applying NTFS/share permissions to control access. The project demonstrates user onboarding processes and how to ensure secure, automated access to department resources through Group Policy. Validated configuration by logging in with domain users and confirming mapped drive functionality.
